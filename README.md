MachineLearning
===============
Planned as a repository for some machine learning alogrithms and examples. Initially using Python (Nootbook), R and maybe a little Matlab.

To use the .ipynb files you will either need to open/import them into iPython Notebook or use a viewer like http://nbviewer.ipython.org/.

An example can be seen by going to this web address...
